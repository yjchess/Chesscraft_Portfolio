            <h1>Hobbies</h1>
            <p>Despite Chesscraft's numerous exploits and highly ambitiious goals, he is still human. And as a human, he still has his own interests, likes and wants separate to those of his goals. Whilst it is possible for these hobbies to develop into something more serious, for the moment - they remain hobbies. Purely activities Chesscraft does for fun. Although that is not to say that Chesscraft does not give them his full attention when doing these activities. On the contrary, Chesscraft will strive to do the best in everything that he does.</p>

In fact, it is arguable that video games are the saving grace that helped Chesscraft survive and become the man he is today. They have been such a vital part of his life and have probably saved his life on more than one occasion.</p>

                                    <p>Chesscraft loved the skill based nature of MOBA games, and League was the first game to introduce him to the concept of Esports (despite playing SC2).

                        <p> It is no understatement to say that RTS Games have perhaps been some of the most influential games in my life. My Journey in RTS games begins with the nostalgic scenes of childhood, wherein my brother would share his usbs or dvds with me so I could install and play Starcraft 1, followed shortly by Age of Empires III. I can remember vividly now when I would battle against my brother and he would allow me to build a mass of units, before suddenly dismantling me with his array of stealthed units.</p>
            
                        <p> The strategies in RTS games are limitless and creativity can flow free. The possible moves and required mechanics to play perfectly are nigh infinite - hence there are always improvements to be had, and no two games are the same. It is because of this, that I feel like I can fully express myself through Real Time Strategy Games. Each tiny movement, each building, unit and more were planned directly by me and are an extension of my will made into code.</p>
            
            
                        <p>When Starcraft II became free to play - I jumped with joy, and it became one of my goals to become recognized and adored in the SCII community. I came close a few times, with my appearances on famous Youtuber channels like: WinterStarcraft, X5_Pig and Florencio, however - I never really made it far enough. My most famous appearances are on a series called Bronze League Heroes - by Winterstarcraft, wherein he casts players with unique styles of play. For me, this was a focus on micro, the fact that I would try to never give up and the overbuilding of workers.</p>
            
                        <p>Unfortunately, due to recent events - Chesscraft is making preparations for the transition from SC2 to a different RTS. This is due to the changes announced at Blizzard. He currently is supporting an up and coming game called: IMMORTAL: Gates of Pyre.</p>

                                <p> Chesscraft has always had a flair for creativity since a very young age. Whilst at first his ambitions pointed him towards the idea of becoming an inventor, he slowly discovered other methods of expressing himself creatively.</p>

                                <p>Chesscraft's life of reading began from a very young age. Given his brother's books, he began to explore the wildly imaginative worlds of Roald Dahl and C.S. Lewis. Perhaps it was these books which caused Chesscraft to have such interest in the strange and unique, the colourful and unexplored.</p>
    
                                <p>At 6 years of age, Chesscraft's brother gave to him his first Harry Potter Novel; Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. It is interesting that at first Chesscraft was mostly disinterested in the book - feeling bored after having read only the first few pages about a cat. However, after being encouraged to give it another go, he became heavily invested in the world of Harry Potter. </p>
    
    
                            
                            </div>
                            
                            
                            
                            <div id="Article2" class="tabcontent p-2">
                                <img src="images/artistry.jpg" class="w-50" alt="">
                                <p> However, Literature is but one method through which creativity may be expressed. Whilst words may paint a picturesque scene in one's mind - it is often said that: "a picture paints a thousand words". From the very start, Chesscraft has always loved artistry. He enjoyed drawing with a pencil most of all, and whilst other kids his age would hate the rain during break - he always looked forward to rainy days, because he would be allowed to draw inside.</p>

                                <p>Chesscraft always enjoyed the sensation of drawing freely, to let the art flow onto the page as his imagination ran wild. However, that being said - he always preferred working with pencil and paper from a young age due to the ease of erasing out mistakes.</p>
    
                                <p>One of the most memorable pieces that Chesscraft created was an abstract painting that he painted. His teacher hung the piece on the wall and when asked by the other students why a year 7's artwork was up on the wall with all the sixth former's works he replied that he loved the piece because of it's duality; the way it was both so simple and yet so complicated. The piece had many interpretations, it could be something as miniscule as an atom or as large as the start of the universe. I would love to show you the piece, but unfortunately it is no longer in my posession. </p>
    
                                <p>Chesscraft has since transitioned to more digital art like digital sculpting and 2d digital art. Unfortunately due to the mental wall he experiences due to executive dysfunction he no longer draws as much as he used to in his youth, but is working on building that back up.</p>

                                <img src="images/miniatures.jpg" class="w-25 s" alt="">
                                <p>On top of Literature and Art, Chesscraft also loves to create/edit objects in real life. Whether this may be from folding Origami, to assembling and painting miniatures - Chesscraft loves this kind of hobby. He has always taken a liking towards creating physical objects with love and detail.</p>

                                <p>Some of these projects like Origami and Paper Toys were only a part of his life briefly, but yet - he still loved them all. Other hobbies, like his growing Warhammer 40K and Age of Sigmar model collection are still present in his life. Chesscraft has always had a fancy for detailed models and figures. He is also an avid collector (albeit a broke collector who relies more on gifts than buying his own) and has collected multiple gogos, figures and other toys.</p>
    
                                <p>Recently Chesscraft has discovered a new hobby: crocheting. It is a relatively cheap hobby, which can produce some of the most adorable toys and is challenging enough to be fun.</p>

                                <div class="accordion-body"> &nbsp;As an artform, Anime has a generally simplistic style, but the ability to exaggerate and showcase amazing detail without sacrificing too much of the original style. The stories portrayed by Anime are limitless, and are filled with creative, expressive and peculiar characters. From Ninjas with no Genjutsu or Taijutsu to a pirate who always gets lost - there are endless zany, lovable characters to adore and love as they play out their journeys.

                                However, Animes don't have to only be great fantastical adventures, on the contrary - there are plenty great animes on topics/genres such as: Slice of Life, Mental Health, Romance and more. As such, I have organized a selection of my favourite animes for you guys:

                                          Working is a slightly lesser known slice of life anime that has been a staple favourite of mine for multiple years. Since a very young age, I have always wanted to have a job with friendly co-workers, where I can grow and nurture my relationships with everyone. To me, working fulfilled that fantasy and I loved seeing the characters laugh in joy with each other.

                                        <dd class="col-sm-9">This anime is also a slice of life anime, however - what stands out are the eccentric characters. The characters are all incredibly talented and hardworking and have produced amazing creations. Their actions have inspired me and in fact, one of the applications I am building is based off the 'maid-chan' in this anime. Be warned though, there is a fair bit of fan service.</dd>

Although there are comedies like Konosuba, most of these are more serious stories about saving the world after being reincarnated. These animes are similar in theme to fantasy animes like Goblin Slayer.</dd>

The anime definitely gave me new ideas and concepts to explore and think about. Whilst my worldview has not changed to match the cynical worldview of Light Yagami, I've come to understand this perspective more.</dd>
