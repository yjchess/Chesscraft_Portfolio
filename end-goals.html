            <h1>End Goals</h1>
            <p>Here you can see all of Chesscraft's greatest goals that he wishes to complete before the end of his life. Once these goals have been finished, Chesscraft can relax more and be more at peace with dying. Some goals may take shorter to complete than others, and others may end up too difficult to achieve. There will be general goals, and specific goals with some overlap.</p>
        </main>

        <section>

            <div class="flexContainer">
                <h1>Generalized Goals</h1>
            </div>

            <div class="mcard2">
                
                <h2>Change the World for the better</h2>
            </div>

            <p>On the surface, this seems like a very generic, vague goal to have. But this is by design, as Chesscraft isn't entirely sure himself how he would be able to change the world. There are multiple issues that Chesscraft sees within the world right now, issues with: Conflict, education, truthfulness and mental health e.t.c. He wants to change them all for the better, but this may not be possible as he is but one man himself.</p>
            
            <section>
                <p>Below is a list of the main issues Chesscraft wants to help make better in the world:</p>
            
                <ol>
                    <li> <span class="red">Mental Health:</span> Chesscraft believes that mental health is not only overlooked by people, but also severely misunderstood. He believes that it is not enough to simply bring the topic up. Whilst facebook posts may raise awareness of the issue, they do very little to actively solve the issue. From his experience, people simply do not know how to support or interact with people who have mental health issues, and can often make matters worse or abandon people.</li>
                    <li> <span class="red">Education:</span> Chesscraft believes that the current methods of education are fundamentally flawed. We teach our students to blindly memorize without understanding or purpose. Furthermore, students are not given enough choice to fully pursue their own dreams and hopes. It would make more sense for a complete overhaul of the education system, to introduce new systems where teachers are encouraged to motivate and support the growth of all students - to go above and beyond in helping students with their growth. </li>
                    <li> <span class="red">Conflict:</span> As it is right now, the world is a shambles. Whilst not everything is terrible or on fire, that is not to say that there is no corruption - no suffering or pain. The world suffers many problems, many of which are self-imposed pointless problems. The hostility between people for example, is sometimes so pointless and stupid but yet people have died for stupid arguments or because of beliefs. We need to realize we are all one race, and should work together to improve life for all. The constant bickering between companies and countries, the trade wars - the accusations, everything is just so stupid as it hampers human progress and advancement. </li>
                    <li> <span class="red">Growth and Redemption:</span> I believe that everyone should be entitled to a second chance. We should give and help people to improve themselves, and we should really try to understand people too. Hardly anybody is bad just because they want to be bad. People often do bad things for specific reasons. We should try to help people become better versions of themselves. On top of this, I wish we could teach people to be more compassionate and caring onto other people. </li>
    
                </ol>

            <div class="mcard2">
                <h2>Attain Fame</h2>
            </div>
            
            <p>Again, on the surface level - this goal seems very generic and perhaps not a very good one. However, this goal is multi-layered in that fame can be used in multiple ways. For example, fame could be used to give a platform for the person to speak on where there will be more attention and thought on his words. However, that is not to say that Chesscraft wouldn't enjoy fame - on the contrary - he would love to be loved and appreciated for the work and skill he displays too. He just hopes that it doesn't go to his head or in some way corrupt him or prevent him from doing what he wants to do.</p>

                    <h2>Novels</h2>
                </div>
                <p>Chesscraft has always wanted to write and publish his own novels since an extremely young age. It has been a lifelong dream of mine, and is one of the ways I would like to immortalize my legacy and leave my mark on this Earth for when I pass on. I currently have two series in mind which will be the crux of my focus, with one taking up 8 books (Dewa) and the other only taking up 3 (Commander Shuring). He would also like to have one off novels. </p>
                <p>However, one of the most important Novels that Chesscraft would love to publish before his death would be an autobiography detailing the struggles and thoughts he had throughout his life.</p>

                    <h2 class="mcard2">Blogs/Magazine</h2>
                </div>
                <p>Chesscraft would love the opportunity to have his thoughts and ideas written down on paper to be shared with other people in order to have deep educated debates and discussions on how to solve current world problems such as mental health, education and environmental issues. He would love for his writing to find a way to reach out to people suffering and to be able to help people.</p>

            	</div>            
            	<p>Chesscraft wishes to be at such a standard that he can draw characters, landscapes and objects and feel pleased with his work. He would like for his art skills to be at the point wherein they may be used professionaly for things like games, showcases, comissions etc. But most important of all - he would like to be able to be proud of his work and enjoy browsing through his own works.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Chesscraft would extremely like to release a RPG game and a platformer. He already has plotlines and plans for both of these. A more complicated goal would be to build an RTS - however, Chesscraft realistically knows that he most likely won't be able to produce an amazing indie solo developed RTS Game.</p>

                    <h2>Maid Chan</h2>
                </div>
    
                <p>Maid Chan started off as a passion project based off an anime that Chesscraft saw. However, he would like to expand maid chan to be a software that would help people be efficient and safe using technology as well as to provide a form of artificial intelligence friendship to users.</p>

                    <h2 class="mcard2">Pro Gamer</h2>
                </div>
                <p>This is perhaps a not as serious dream now. Chesscraft has a limited amount of time to do everything and with his limited resources in terms of energy and time, it would be a little hard to become a professional gamer - however nonetheless, this is a goal that he has although it may be put on the backburner for a while.</p>

                </div>
    
                <p>Chesscraft wants to not only raise awareness of the issue on Mental Health, but also reach out to people and help them in their times of need. As such, he would love to make videos on Mental Health both for his own benefit and to help those who suffered similarly. He wants to build an environment that promotes recovery, self-improvement and comradery.</p>

                <p>Chesscraft really wants to give back to his community and help those who are in need. This may take many different forms such as donation, or doing volunteer work or simply helping out wherever I can.</p>
