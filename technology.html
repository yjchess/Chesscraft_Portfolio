                            Chesscraft's Comp Sci Journey began with ICT and Comp Sci in primary and secondary school. He began learning how to build websites, animate simple animations and more during this time. Learning the basics of html, css and javascript. In secondary school, Chesscraft began to learn his first major programming language: python. Despite at this point having tried out multiple programming languages, python was chosen for his curriculum due to it's powerful nature and relative simplicity to pick up and learn.

Later on, he would go on to do work experience at Rutherford Laboratory where he picked up skills like php. Before University, Chesscraft also completed an EPQ wherein he created a website for the company: APLondon Services, which sells handmade luxury soaps and other such goods. He was also a member of the Game Development Club at secondary school, as well as Robotics.
