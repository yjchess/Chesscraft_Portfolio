            <p>On this page, you will be able to see all the projects that Chesscraft will be working towards at some point in the future. These may be projects that happen weeks from now, or projects that will end up being started a very long time from now, for example in a year. Each project will have a rough estimate of when they will be started.</p>

            <p>With the first draft of the website complete, there are still quite a few knicks and bits to work out. These include, but are not limited to - the improvement of the aesthetics of each page, the spacing between content, any weird margins etc., making the code more readable, and trying to reduce the amount of code written where appropriate. There will also need to be maintenance work done, keeping everything up to date and adding content (i.e. images).</p>
