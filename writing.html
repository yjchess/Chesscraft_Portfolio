            <h1>Writing</h1>
            <p> Since a very young age, chesscraft has always had his lifelong goal of becoming an author. This has always been one of Chesscraft's most deep and important desires. Whilst he currently suffers from mental walls that prevent him from writing as much as he wants. He is still pushing hard and hopes to one day write: A series of 8 fantasy books, 2 shorter novellas and a non-fiction book on his life, his struggles and his mental health.</p>

            <h2>Software + Skills</h2>
            <p> To create, edit and improve his <strong>articles</strong>, Chesscraft uses a variety of software, techniques, locations and more. Here are a sample of some of the resources that Chesscraft uses:</p>

        <p>These are some articles I wrote for an RTS connoseiur. waywardstrategy picks apart mechanics and features of Real Time Strategy Games, and analyses them in his blog. I made these two articles as a form of work experience, and to gain a deeper more complete understanding of how to write for different formats.</p>

         <h1>Wattpad Stories</h1>
        </div>

        <p>These stories are pieces of work I mostly began between the years of 2014 to 2018. With the exception of The Artefact, most of these stories were passion projects I started in secondary school. Unfortunately, due to mental health - I had to take a break from writing, however, I hope that one day I will regain my passion and drive and overcome the mental walls of which I have built up internally.</p>

            <h1>Other</h1>
        </div>
        <p>On top of these exploits, Chesscraft has also written for his school magazine. Reporting on his win as the British Under 13 Chess Champion. He has also written passages and about sections for clients using the Frega website. Indeed, Chesscraft to this day still helps a lot of friends and family with passages, wheter that may be emails, documents or other such pieces.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately due to the nature and unpredictability of Chesscraft's mental health - he is currently unable to write as much as he would like, however - he is trying to push past his mental walls (executive dysfunction) and produce more and more as time goes by. He can currently write at about a rate of 2 pages per day, but ends up exhausted and spent. However - through the use of the technique: non-zero days - he currently hopes to be able to publish a book by the end of this year.</p>
